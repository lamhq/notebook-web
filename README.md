## Development Workflow

This project use [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). The following table is the rule of branch name.

| name | description |
| :--- | :--- |
| master | production branch, master branch is always deployable. |
| feature/{name} | this branch is derived from master. use it when you develop a new function. |
| fix/{name} | this branch is derived from a master branch. use it when you fix bug. |
| hotfix/{name} | this branch is derived from a release tag. use it when you fix urgent bugs for a version. |

Your branch name is automatically checked when committing by [git-branch-is](https://github.com/kevinoid/git-branch-is).

Here's a typical workflow when working on a ticket

1. Make sure to create a branch and a pull request **before starting development**.

```sh
git checkout -b feature/setup-env-be
npm run preversion # check your branch name is correct format.
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: setup env be"
```

2. Create a pull request in bitbucket, please prepend `[WIP]` to your pull request's title.
3. Start development of your task. Update the PR every day.
4. When you finish the task, remove `[WIP]` from the pull request's title, assign it to reviewer.
